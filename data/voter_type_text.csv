Meaningful (General),Meaningful,"Congrats! You were one of just 14% of Iowa voters that had an opportunity to vote in a competitive general election in November. Beyond that, since you are a member of one of Iowa's two major parties, you also have the opportunity to vote in the primary and give input on who the candidates might be."
None-of-the-Above,Meaningful,"Congrats! You were one of just 14% of Iowa voters that had an opportunity to vote in a competitive general election in November. Unfortunately, since you are not a member of one of the two major parties, you do not have input on who the candidates will be. Voters in your position often are forced to vote for the candidate they dislike the least, and could be described as a ""None-of-the-Above"" voter."
Outnumbered,Non-Meaningful,"As a voter in a minority party in a non-competitive district, you are outnumbered by the majority party. In districts like these, the election's winner is essentially decided in the majority party's primary--a primary that you are not able to participate in because Iowa has closed primaries."
Unneeded,Non-Meaningful,"Although your party's candidate won the general election, they won by a large enough margin that your vote was unneeded. In non-competitive districts, the election winner is essentially decided in the majority party's primary election. Unfortunately, your party's candidate did not face any primary opponents, so you did not have any viable choices at any point in the electoral process."
Excluded,Non-Meaningful,"As a voter who is not registered with a major party, and is not in a competitive district, you are excluded from the election process. Because the general election is uncompetitive, the winner in your district is essentially decided in the majority party's primary, which you do not have access to because Iowa has closed primaries."
Meaningful (Primary),Non-Meaningful,"Although you did not have the opportunity to participate in a competitive general election, you did have the opportunity to participate in a primary where there were at least two choices. Your top choice may or may not have advanced to the general election, but voting in a primary that even has multiple candidates is an opportunity that most Iowans do not have."
